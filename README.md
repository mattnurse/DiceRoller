# DiceRoller
Rolls combinations of dice to show that larger samples are more likely to show characteristics of an expected population. For example, when throwing three six-sided dice you would theoretically expect to find a normal distribution. However this is much more likely if you were to throw this combination many times. This project shows this to be the case and also produces a table of commonly-used descriptive statistics.   

This project has been deployed as a Shiny App which I have made available here - https://mattnurse.shinyapps.io/DiceRoller/
